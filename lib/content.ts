// HOW TO EDIT
//   • Change any text below freely.
//   • `node` ties a story to a star in lib/figure.ts (e.g. "n31"). To move a
//     story onto a different star, change `node`. To make `connectsTo` glow,
//     the two stars must share an edge in figure.ts.
//   • `section` sets the color: motivations → gold, iic → electric blue,
//     background → silver. `size` sets brightness: largest|large|medium|small.
//   • Array order = keyboard tab order.
//   • Footer is SOCIAL_LINKS + BIRTH_ISO at the bottom.
